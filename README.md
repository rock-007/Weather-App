# Educational App
A user is looking for an app to give them quick access to weather information for cities in the UK. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP
A user should be able to:

- view information on the weather forecast for a particular city in the UK
- be able to interact with the page to submit a city to tailor the information displayed to that city
- be able to display the information retrieved in a graphical format e.g. a chart

## Possible Extensions
- Use a map to display the weather forecast.
- Save favourite places into a database to allow quick viewing of particular places of interest to the user. 
- Display historical weather records for places as well as the forecast.
